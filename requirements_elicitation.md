# Requirements Elicitation Techniques

## Design Interview
Design interviews involve direct interaction with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations. This technique helps in understanding the requirements from the user's perspective and ensures that the final product meets their expectations.

### Steps:
1. Identify stakeholders and schedule interviews.
2. Prepare a list of questions to cover all aspects of the project.
3. Conduct interviews and take detailed notes.
4. Analyze the collected data to identify key requirements.

## Record Review
Record review involves analyzing existing documentation, such as project reports, user manuals, and system logs, to gather information about the current system and its requirements. This technique helps in understanding the existing system and identifying areas for improvement.

### Steps:
1. Collect relevant documents and records.
2. Review the documents to extract useful information.
3. Identify gaps and areas for improvement.
4. Document the findings and use them to define requirements.

## Brainstorming

### Steps:
1. Define the objectives of the questionnaire.
2. Prepare a list of questions covering all aspects of the project.
3. Distribute the questionnaire to stakeholders.
4. Collect and analyze the responses to identify key requirements.

## Observation
Observation involves directly observing users as they interact with the current system or perform their tasks. This technique helps in understanding the user's workflow and identifying any pain points or areas for improvement.

### Steps:
1. Identify the users and tasks to be observed.
2. Schedule observation sessions and obtain consent from users.
3. Observe users and take detailed notes on their interactions and challenges.
